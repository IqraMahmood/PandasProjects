## Sample And Population

SUM = $\sum$

Population Size = $N$

Sample size = $n$

Population mean. = $\mu$

sample mean. = x¯

Standard deviation of a population = $\sigma$

Standard deviation of a sample = $\sigma_n$

Variance of a population = $\sigma^2$

Variance of a sample = $\sigma_n^2$

---

## Hypothesis Testing

Null hypothesis - $H_0$

Alternative hypothesis - $H_1$

significance level - $p$

probability of the null hypothesis = $P(H_0)$

probability of committing a Type II error = $P(H_1)$

## Random Variables

standardized score = $Z$

chi-square  = $\chi^2$

---

## Linear Regression

intercept constant in a population regression model = $\beta_0$

regression coefficient in a population regression line = $\beta_1$

Coefficient of determination = $R^2$

intercept constant in a sample regression line = $\beta_0_n$

Regression coefficient in a sample regression line = $\beta_1$

standard error of the slope of a regression line = $\sigma_\beta$

---

## Probability

---
Probability that event A will occur = $P(A)$

Conditional probability that event A occurs, given that event B has occurred = $P(A|B)$

Probability of the complement of event A =   $P(A\`)$

Probability of the intersection of events A and B = $P(A∩B)$

Probability of the union of events A and B. = $P$($A \cup B$)

Expected value of random variable X = $E(X)$

---

## Permutation/Combination

Factorial value of n = $n!$

Number of permutations of n things taken r at a time = $nPr$

Number of combinations of n things taken r at a time = $nCr$

---

## Set

Intersection of set A and B = $A \cap B$

Union of set A and B = $A \cup B$

Null or empty set = $∅$
